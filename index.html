		<h1>About Me:</h1>
		<p>I am an 18 year old student of computer science living in Kansas. Currently iâ€™m taking classes at Johnson County Community college, and will begin attending Washburn University in the Fall.</p>
		<p>While I am not currently taking any classes concerning computer science, over the past few months Ive made it my hobby. On the left you'll find just a few projects I have put together in the past weeks.</p>
		<h1>Why Coding?:</h1>
		<p>My first experience with programing came as a class in high school class that taught the bare basics of JavaScript. While this class in the end had little impact over my actual programing abilities, it showed me a side of technology, and even a side of myself that I had never seen before.Never before had I found a class that focused on applying logic and reasoning to solve problems. I love being able to sit down, think about a problem critically, and see my solution resolve an issue. </p>
		<h1>My Interests:</h1>
		<p>Unfortunately balancing work and school has left me with little time to pursue my interests. In highschool I made it my goal to become as well rounded as possible. This meant finding many different activities and clubs to join. I found great joy in doing forensics and theater at my school. I did Science Olympiad for a full four years, which greatly sharpened my problem solving skills. In Junior year of highschool I joined the cross country team, to which I attribute my strong work ethic.</p>
